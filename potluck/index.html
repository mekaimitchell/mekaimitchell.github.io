            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3><b>DIRECTIONS</b></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 
                9-inch springform pan. Set aside.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Make crumb topping by combining 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 
                2 tablespoons lemon zest, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1/4 
                teaspoon salt. Cut in cold butter until mixture resembles coarse 
                sand. Set aside.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                In another bowl combine 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, and 
                1/4 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar until 
                creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. 
                Add lemon extract, vanilla, 2 tablespoons lemon zest and 1/4 cup 
                lemon juice. Add dry ingredients and mix just until all 
                ingredients are moistened.
            </li>
                <br>           
            <li>
                Spread batter into pan, top with lemon curd and add crumble \
                evenly over top. Bake until a toothpick inserted near the center 
                comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. 
                Remove springform pan; sprinkle confectioner’s sugar over top of 
                cake.
            </li>

        <h3><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h3>
        
        <h4>Frosting</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup / 30 grams freeze-dried raspberries, finely ground in a 
                food processor or spice grinder
            </li>

            <li>
                1 cup / 225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room 
                temperature
            </li>
            <li>2cups/245 grams confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cookies</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                ½ cup / 115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
            </li>

            <li>
                3 ounces / 85 grams cream cheese, at room temperature
            </li>
            <li>1 cup / 200 grams granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2¼ cups / 285 grams cake flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>Sprinkles, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3><b>DIRECTIONS</b></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the cookies: In a large bowl, using a spoon, cream the 
                butter, cream cheese, sugar and salt until smooth and fluffy. 
                Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and whisk to incorporate some 
                air and to dissolve the sugar crystals, about 1 minute. Stir in 
                the flour and baking powder until just incorporated.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Heat oven to 350 degrees and line two rimmed sheet pans with 
                parchment paper. Using two spoons or a cookie scooper, plop out 
                2-tablespoon/50-gram rounds spaced a couple of inches apart. 
                (You should get about 7 to 8 cookies per sheet pan.) Place the 
                sheet pans in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until the dough 
                is no longer sticky and easier to handle.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                While the dough chills, make the frosting: In a fine-mesh sieve 
                set over a medium bowl, sift the ground raspberries, using a 
                spoon to help pass them through, until most of the ruby-red 
                powder is in the bowl and most of the seeds are left behind in 
                the sieve. (Discard the seeds.)
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                To the bowl, add the 1 cup butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla 
                extract and salt and, with an electric hand mixer, mix on low 
                speed until the butter absorbs the sugar. Then, turn the speed 
                up to high and beat until the frosting doubles in size, about 2 
                minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber 
                spatula to ensure all the ingredients are incorporated. Transfer 
                the frosting to a small container, cover tightly, and set aside. 
                (You should have about 2 cups of frosting.)
            </li>
                <br>           
            <li>
                Remove the sheet pans from the freezer. Roll the chilled dough 
                into even balls and flatten them slightly with your fingers so 
                they’re about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. Bake the cookies 
                for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans and switching racks 
                halfway through, or until they no longer look wet on top, are 
                still light in color and spring back to the touch. They will 
                puff up and crack slightly. Let cool completely on the sheet 
                pan. (They will continue to cook as they sit.)
            </li>
                <br>           
            <li>
                Using a butter knife or offset spatula, frost each cooled cookie 
                with the raspberry frosting and adorn with the sprinkles.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <h3><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups cold heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 ounces good-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>4 ounces good-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
         </ul>

         <br>
         <h3><b>DIRECTIONS</b></h3>

         <ol>
            <li>
                Whip 1 cup of the heavy cream to soft peaks in a medium bowl. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Add the egg, egg yolks, sugar, espresso powder, vanilla extract, 
                salt and 1 tablespoon water to a medium heatproof bowl and whisk 
                to combine. Set the bowl over a medium saucepan of gently 
                simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water). 
                Whisk constantly until the mixture is pale, hot to the touch and 
                has almost doubled in volume, about 4 to 6 minutes, scraping 
                down the sides of the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula, 
                if necessary. Remove from the heat and continue whisking until 
                cooled, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
                 <br>
            <li>
                Put the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set 
                over the saucepan of gently simmering water (do not allow the 
                bowl to touch the water). Stir occasionally with a rubber 
                spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from 
                the heat and gently stir for about 3 minutes to cool slightly.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Whisk the egg mixture into the melted chocolate in 3 additions 
                until combined. (The mixture may get very thick.) Using a rubber 
                spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate 
                mixture in 3 additions until it is fully incorporated. It is 
                important that the chocolate mixture is not warm to ensure that 
                it combines smoothly with the whipped cream without seizing up.
            </li>
                <br>           
            <li>
                Divide the chocolate mousse among four 4-ounce ramekins and 
                chill until firm, about 1 hour.
            </li>
                <br>           
            <li>
                Whip the remaining 3/4 cup cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. Top 
                each chocolate mousse with whipped cream and serve. (For a 
                softer texture, allow the ramekins to sit at room temperature 
                while you whip the cream.)
